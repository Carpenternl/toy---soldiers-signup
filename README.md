# Airsoft Signup site

When I go to play airsoft at my local compound, our group sends a message to the owners of what kind of snacks we want.
however, sometimes messages get mixed up and not everyone gets their snacks at the end of the day.

Using this ASP.NET web-app allows airsoft-participants to:
- enter their credentials
- Set set their attendance
- Add the snacks that they want

Administrators will be able to 
- login with their credentials
- view a list of requested snacks
- view a list of attendees
